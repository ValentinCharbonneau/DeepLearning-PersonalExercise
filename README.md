# Personal deep learning exercise

## Description
This is a personnal exercise in the order to understand how perceptron network and gradient backpropagation work.

## Technical
GCC compiler avec Make are recommended to compile this project with the Makefile.
This project respect the C99 standard.
THis project use the *math.h* library, so the argument *-lm* are require with GCC

## Networks
The program asks you to choose one of 3 models :
 - 1 - A simple XOR model
 - 2 - A more complexe model, gives the probability that the entry belongs to a class
 - 3 - A model with 2 outputs, gives the class to which the entry belongs
