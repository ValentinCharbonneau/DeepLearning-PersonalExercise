# Personal deep learning exercise

## Description
This is a personal exercise aimed at understanding how perceptron networks and gradient backpropagation work.

## Technical
The GCC compiler with Make is recommended to compile this project with the Makefile.
This project adheres to the C99 standard.
This project uses the *math.h* library, so the argument *-lm* is required with GCC.

## Networks
The program asks you to choose one of 3 models:
 - 1 - A simple XOR model
 - 2 - A more complex model that gives the probability that the input belongs to a certain class
 - 3 - A model with 2 outputs that determines the class to which the input belongs
